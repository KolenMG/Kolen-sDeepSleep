 Kolen's Deep Sleep — Advanced Sleep & Night Skip Plugin (1.21.x)


KDeepSleep is a premium-quality Minecraft sleep plugin (for FREE) designed for modern servers running Minecraft 1.21.x. It delivers a smooth, immersive, and fully configurable sleeping experience while maintaining strict anti-exploit protections and game balance.

With elegant sky animations, smart sleep detection, and a powerful “sleep-most” system, KDeepSleep allows servers to skip the night naturally—without breaking immersion or server integrity.
Tested mostly on 1.21.10, if you are testing this plugin, please let me know the version used.

✨ Key Features
️ Smart Bed Command

    Players can use /bed (with permission) to instantly spawn a temporary bed near them.

    The bed is placed safely, aligned with the player’s facing direction, and only when conditions allow it.

    Players are automatically put to sleep.

    Once the player wakes up or leaves the bed, it is fully despawned, leaving no items behind.

Immersive Night Skipping

    Night skipping is handled through a smooth sky transition animation, along with a nice text and particles around the player - not an instant time jump.

    The night is skipped when a configurable number or percentage of players are sleeping.

    Supports:
        Percentage-based sleep requirements

        Fixed player count

        Per-world configuration
